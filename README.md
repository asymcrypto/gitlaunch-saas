## 🧠 Why GitLaunch Exists

Most developers struggle to launch a SaaS because they start with code instead of a **system**.

GitLaunch solves that.

It gives you:

✅ The **codebase**  
✅ The **community infrastructure**  
✅ The **AI co-builder workflow**  
✅ The **build-in-public strategy**

GitLaunch is not “just a template” — it's a **Launch System**.

Building SaaS is hard because you need:

❌ AI integration  

Most templates give you code only.  
GitLaunch gives you **the entire system**.
